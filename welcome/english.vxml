             Korea uses its own language and uses Hangul, a unique script created by King Sejong the Great (1397-1450) of the Joseon Dynasty. 
             Hangul has been recognized internationally as an excellent alphabet because it is easy to learn and use. In particular, 
             it is scientifically outstanding in that it can record a large number of speech sounds by combining 24 letters.
